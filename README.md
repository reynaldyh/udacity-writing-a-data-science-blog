This repo is for first project in Udacity's  Data Science Nanodegree program.

## Dataset
Stack Overflow is founded in 2008, and has been a platform that nearly every developer visits. For me personally, Stack Overflow has helped me develop my coding skills and debug the code since I was in college.

So in this projects, we only focus in 2017-2020 dataset that you might found within this [link](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)

Note: please create dataset folder and put the csv data in there

## Business Understanding:
Stack Overflow’s annual developer survey has been around us for almost a decade. The last survey was taken in February 2020 (before the pandemic hit us), although time changes after the pandemic, so the survey may not relevant anymore. However, we may analyze the trend before the pandemic, and added the pandemic data for knowing that the pandemic has effect us as developers. But for now we focus only in 2017–2020 data, which leads us to some question mention on project motivation.

### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow data to better understand:
- The trend of the number of respondents that filling the survey?
- The trend of average salary of the Stack Overflow’s respondent over 2017–2020?
- The trend of programming as a hobby over 2017–2020?

### Libraries
I use Python3. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:

Numpy
Pandas
matplotlib.pyplot
